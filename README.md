sshlog
======

a command-line log-assembler utility, for terminal- / mobile- and NAS-devices.

sshlog is a command-line log-assembler utility, meant for Linux administrators / datacenter operators with sufficient command-line interface (CLI) experience. It was prototyped to be useful on computer-terminals and mobile devices, like Android-powered smart-phones/tablets/notebooks and similar low-power computers.

Allthough originally written for server-use, it has proven to be quite a useful log-assembler tool on any Linux-box that runs an OpenSSH-server :)

Personally, I've deployed it on all my Linux-powered devices (like: NAS-boxes, laptops, VPS', workstations, routers, etc.) to provide simple, text-based log-access throughout my network-infrastructure. Giving me complete access-history at my fingertips, wherever, whenever.

I've modified the base-script to run on: Debian GNU/Linux, Netgear RAIDiator (ReadyNAS), Ubuntu Server / Desktop and Linux Mint.

If you get a mod of your own to run on a specific distribution, please, feel free to mail a copy to me and I'll add it to the repo (and give appropriate accredidation on the website, of course)
